  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p> <span class="clubName">Girls in Tech</span> is an after-school club at Park City High School open to anyone. We are a group of 20 girls who get together every other week to learn new technologies by building projects.<div id = "logo"> <img src="logo_small.png" alt="" width="100" height="124" class="logo"/> </div></p>

  <h2>Why should I join Girls in Tech?</h2>
  <p>Computing is where the jobs are â€” and where they will be in the future, but fewer than 1 in 5 computer science graduates are women. We aim to change that. <span class="clubName">Girls in Tech</span>'s mission is to close the gender gap in technology by exposing girls to computer science and giving them skills they need to be comfortable in whatever career they pursue.</p>
  
  <p>Also, it is fun.</p>
